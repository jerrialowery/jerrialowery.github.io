<h1 class="OverviewPageHeader">Overview</h1>

<p class="Overview"> Technology is a significant tool that steadily grows and
    plays a major role in our society. The majority of
    people from all ages participate in using technology,
    with a variety of different devices. Technology
    also has a big flaw that's causes many consumers of tech to become vulnerable. In the sense of vulnerability many technology consumer's identities become unprotected and easily fall into an area of being compromised. We are easily being manipulated by hackers, phishing messages, spam attacks, duplication of social media accounts, pop-up adds and many other cyber-attacks.
<br></br>
Many tools of manipulation create the feeling of paranoia amongst individuals, who sense that their online presence is being threatened. People tend to cover up their web cams, use pop-up add blockers, and use private browsing tools. The threat is real, and we constantly feel that someone is watching us and tracking our online footprint. The goal of this project is to create awareness around the idea of identities being compromised and simulate the process of identity vulnerability.<br></br> Mediums used will include both digital and print. Digital media will include a website that houses the simulation and an informative motion graphic. The simulation will be created to involve the audience's interaction and participate in the process of events that lures in personal information. The simulation will contain several of questions and examples that tries to get the user to input information and responds with an output. Awareness around identity protection will be communicated through a series of print media posters. Approximately four posters will be created and contain infographics with real facts and data research. The printed posters will also support ideas expressed in digital media. The targeted audience is the general public, which connects to anyone who uses technology on any device.
